### What is LAMMPS-HESSIAN? ###

LAMMPS-HESSIAN is a compute module for the LAMMPS software package which
provides a method of generating the forward-difference numerical Hessian matrix
on the fly duing any LAMMPS simulation.

### Future Work ###

Further improvements will include other numerical procedures and a general
fix-based LAMMPS simulation type in addition to the compute-based approach.
